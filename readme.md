## uColumns Tutorial - Reference Project

Hello and welcome.

If you have reached this repository not from my tutorial itself, know that it can be found at [www.kehomsforge.com](http://www.kehomsforge.com/tutorials/multi/uColumns).

The project found here is meant to be used as reference material while following the tutorial. Of course, the mentioned assets throughout the text are provided in this repository too.

The state of project here contains a few bugs that were detected after the tutorial was considered "finished" and those will remain here, mostly to be an "exact reflection" of what is shown during the text. I honestly don't have any more energy to continue changing the text which often requires changing a lot of things throughout the entire tutorial, which is huge! So, please, when you detect those bugs, don't get angry because they have not been fixed! Yet, the game is very much playable and I do believe it does serve the purpose of showing a bunch of Unreal Engine features and at least one possible way to use them!
